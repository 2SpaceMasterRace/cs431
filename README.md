## Course description

TODO



## Prerequisites

This course assumes a basic understanding of:

- Mathematics (freshman calculus): proposition statement and proof
- Data structures (CS206): linked list, stack, queue
- Systems programming (CS230): memory layout, cacheline, lock

While they are not official prerequisites, without a proper understanding of those topics you will
likely struggle to take this course.


Other recommendations which would greatly help you in this course:

- Basic understanding of computer architecture (CS311)
- Programming experience in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)


## Textbook

- Main: slides (TBA)
- Sub: research papers and concurrency libraries
    + [Promising semantics](https://sf.snu.ac.kr/promise-concurrency/): programming language & ISA
      semantics of shared-memory concurrency
    + [Crossbeam](https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam): concurrent data structure library in
      [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
    + [Iris](https://iris-project.org/): concurrent program logic


## Grading

- Homework & project: 70%
- Final exam: 30%

## Communication

- Course-related announcements and information will be posted on the
  [website](https://github.com/kaist-cp/cs492-concur) as well as on the [GitHub issue
  tracker](https://github.com/kaist-cp/cs492-concur/issues).  You are expected to read all
  announcements within 24 hours of their being posted.  It is highly recommended to watch the
  repository so that new announcements will automatically be delivered to you email address.

- Any technical and administrative questions, unless they are confidential or personal, should be
  asked in the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/kaist-cp/cs492-concur/issues).  Any
  questions failing to do so (e.g. email questions on course materials) will not be answered.

- Emails to the instructor or TAs should begin with "CS492:" in the subject line, followed by a
  brief description of the purpose of your email.  The content should at least contain your name and
  student number.  Any emails failing to do so (e.g. emails without student number) will not be
  answered.

- There is an **unofficial** [Mattermost
  channel](https://cp.kaist.ac.kr/mm/signup_user_complete/?id=43ydjumq9t8xmczans9q4swajh) for
  instant messages.  The instructor may not answer your questions here.  Discussion among students
  is strongly encouraged.
